<h2>Step 2</h2>

<p>For this exercise, I am evaluating the site from the perspective of an undergraduate teacher planning to incorporate original source material into my lesson plan and the learning activities I have planned for my students. I am teaching a lesson about student protests on college campuses in the US. My goal is to find original source material about student protests on college campuses in the US. I also want to check that original source material will be easily accessible for my students via the website. After spending twenty minutes exploring the website, I will share my analysis based on Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics.</p>

<p>1: Visibility of System Status
The website’s design is very user-friendly, with clear navigation and terminology. It is easy to initiate and refine searches of the collection from the “Search Within the Collection” search bar on the homepage.</p>

Users have the option to Refine the Results (via a navigation bar on the left) by:
<ul>
<li>Content Type</li>
<li>Date Range</li>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Access Type</li>
</ul>

There is also a sorting function with options to sort the entire collection by:
<ul>
<li>Newest</li>
<li>Oldest</li>
<li>Title (a-z)</li>
<li>Title (z-a)</li>
<li>Creator (a-z)</li>
<li>Creator (z-a)</li>
<li>Resolution (a-z)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there is one major issue with the navigation. There is a navigation bar at the top of the homepage that includes a hyperlink to the JSTOR homepage and a searchbar to initiate searches in the entire JSTOR database. It is possible students will be confused and try to initiate searches of The Tower archives using the wrong search tool! Doing so would yield a huge range of search results that wouldn’t be the right type of material (i.e. original sources material from The Tower archives) for this class project.</p>

<p>2: Match Between the System and the Real World
The design of the Tower’s archive uses standard search terminology. It is easy to initiate a standard search from the homepage. These phrases and concepts are familiar to most people who use online search functions and are definitely familiar to students at an academic institution like ours.</p>

<p>3: User Control and Freedom
After starting a search, the results page includes a link back to The Tower archives’ homepage. My only critique is that the link is not in a highly visible place and might not be immediately apparent to the user.</p>

<p>There is a prominent link to the JSTOR homepage on the upper left hand corner that might confuse my students.</p>

<p>4: Consistency and Standards
The Tower archive uses consistent terminology, navigation, and visual iconography. It has a consistent interface and it is easy to navigate.</p>

<p>However, the visual consistency actually presents some confusion between the Tower Archive and JSTOR’s wider database. The Tower Archive would benefit from being more clearly delineated from the JSTOR database as a whole so students do not accidentally use the wrong search functions.</p>

<p>5: Error Prevention
I did not encounter any error messages while using The Tower Archive. I do not anticipate my students will encounter any error messages, either.</p>

<p>6: Recognition Rather than Recall
The Tower archive is well designed, with a prominent “Search the Collection” option on the homepage. There are also tools to Refine Results or Browse the Collection. These tools were useful in my search for original source material on student protests on campus.</p>

<p>However, students might have to rely on “recall” to remember the difference between The Tower archive search function and the wider JSTOR search function. Ideally, visual cues or labeling would make this distinction clear to users without relying on their memory or more subtle context clues.</p>

<p>7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
The top navigation bar has shortcuts to a searchbar, Advanced Search, Register, Log In, Browse, and Workspace. These tools are useful for JSTOR users, but might not be necessary for my students. Worse case scenario, the JSTOR options confuse my students who are only required to access The Tower archives.</p>

<p>8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
The website is beautifully designed with a simple interface, clear navigation, and an attractive black, white, and red color scheme. It definitely qualifies as a “minimalist” design and I think it is very pleasing to the user’s eye.</p>


<p>9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
I did not encounter any errors so I cannot evaluate how the interface helps users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. That being said, the user experience is so positive I do not anticipate having problems with errors. The only issues I anticipate are the aforementioned navigation confusion between The Tower archive and the wider JSTOR database.</p>

<p>10: Help and Documentation
I did not require any outside help or documentation before using The Tower archive but I will give my students a heads up that the top navigation bar will take that out of The Tower archive into the wider JSTOR database. I do not want them to get lost and waste time figuring out the distinction for themselves. Some visual delineation of The Tower collection would be really helpful in avoiding this issue.</p>


<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>The top strengths of this system are the clear navigation. The archive is very user-friendly and attractive. The benefits of such a user-friendly system are accessibility for both casual users and experienced archival researchers. Given that the archive is part of a university system, it is especially important that the interface be user friendly for undergraduate users who are likely new to online archives. This resource will provide a positive introduction to online archives for these users.</p>

<p>My chief critique is that users do not have more advanced search options. I was able to use Bolean search terms to narrow my search results, but not as much as I would have liked. My students will have to search carefully (and spend a lot of time) to narrow their search results to student protests on campus in the US.</p>



<h2>Step 5</h2>

<p> Ed (who conducted the mini-usability test) and I agreed that The Tower archive on JSTOR is user-friendly and and well-organized. We both found that the archive is accessible to novice users (such as students who are new to online archives). That being said, we both struggled to find relevant materials with the limited search options. Although The Tower archive provides filtering and sorting functions for searching the collection, it was difficult to refine results without doing a fair bit of scrolling through and sorting relevant results through your own labor. That presents a challenge with such a large archive. Ed provided some particularly useful examples of the limited search capabilities. So while the overall design of the website is user-friendly and easily-navigable, the search functions could use an upgrade so users can narrow down their results to the most relevant materials.</p>
