 <h3>Part I: Description of the Organization and Information System</h3>


<p>This report examines the Wayback Machine, a subsidiary project of the Internet Archive. The mission of the Internet Archive is to “provide Universal Access to All Knowledge” (About the Internet Archive). No effort to capture and share the sum of human knowledge would be complete in this day and age without preserving and sharing the content of the internet! The Wayback Machine is dedicated to doing just that. It is a free and open-source internet archiving tool devoted to archiving all of the content of the internet. The Internet Archive began operating the Wayback Machine in 1996 and the online tool was made available to the public five years later. The Internet Archive, via the Wayback Machine, now stores 835 billion web pages and the collection is growing every day thanks to thousands of contributors, who are free to save web content to the collection as long as they first create a free account with the Internet Archive (About the Internet Archive). The collection of online material is free and open to the public via the Wayback Machine website.</p>

<p>The Wayback Machine is a complex undertaking and capturing web content presents unique challenges. Unlike other archival material - like photographs or newspapers - web content is seldom ‘finished.’ Web content is constantly changing. For example, social media users can regularly add content to their social media pages and blogs are frequently updated. Therefore, capturing and archiving internet content is a continuous process. The Wayback Machine saves “snapshots” of websites from a specific moment in time and web content is organized chronologically in its collection; this allows users to view how websites looked in the past via multiples of these “snapshots” arranged chronologically (WebAsha). Furthermore, there is no guarantee that content available on the web now will remain accessible to the public indefinitely. For example, a newspaper might delete an article from its website with little warning. This adds impetus to the Wayback Machine’s mission to capture as much web content as possible for their collection. That being said, the Wayback Machine does not capture absolutely everything on the internet. The Wayback Machine is able to collect web pages that are publicly available. This excludes web pages protected by a password, pages only accessible by completing an online form, pages located on secure servers, chat logs, or personal email messages. (Wayback Machine General Information). The Wayback Machine is also limited by its web crawling operations and users when it comes to adding to the archive: even combined, they cannot gather everything on the web! So there are gaps in the collection.</p>


<p>The audience for the Wayback Machine (the tool and the collection) includes three main categories of users. First are users who wish to add to the collection using the open-source tools provided by the Wayback Machine. The second category is made up of people wishing to casually browse the collection itself. The third category is made up of users who are searching the collection for specific material from the internet. Because these users have different goals, they will naturally interact with the Wayback Machine in different ways. All users of the Wayback Machine will interact with the website’s homepage, but from there they might branch out to different tools and sections of the website. There are tools specifically designed for users who wish to add to the collection, a search function for users looking for specific items in the collection, and sections of the website suitable for users browsing the collection more casually. The existing information system will be further delineated in the next section of the paper.</p>

<h3>Part II: Evaluation of the Existing Information System</h3>

<p>Users can access the Wayback Machine’s homepage at web.archive.org, which is a subsidiary of the Internet Archive’s website. Once on the Wayback Machine’s homepage, visitors will find a mix of tools for all three categories of users. All might choose to access the Internet Archive’s main navigation bar at the top of the screen, where they can access specific categories of content in the Internet Archive as a whole (for example, “Video” or “Audio” or “Software” content). The top navigation bar also includes links to non-collection items like “About” or “Donate” or “Jobs.” The top navigation bar also includes an hyperlink for those wishing to log into their existing accounts or create a new one. Finally, there is a search bar in the upper right hand corner which searches the entire collection of the Internet Archive. The rest of the homepage offers quite a few other features. There is a main search-bar in the center of the homepage, a carousel of collection highlights (with picture icons) in the middle of the page, and then functions for different users across the bottom third of the page. From left to right, these functions are “Tools,” “Subscription Services,” “Collection Search”, and “Save Page Now.” Some of these functions are directed at searchers and browsers of the collection, while others are directed at users who wish to add to the collection.</p>

<p>Before we discuss the user experience, let’s discuss web crawling and its role in the Wayback Machine’s mission. Web crawling is an important tool for collecting web content for the archive. After all, the internet is so incredibly vast that manually adding individual web pages to the collection one-by-one could never hope to capture it all. Therefore, web-crawling is an important part of the Wayback Machine’s operations, although the Wayback Machine does not operate like a standard web-crawling operation! A standard web-crawling operation is made up of “a single standardized continuous crawl with stable criteria and algorithms” and it operates every single day, all year long (Leetaru, 2016). Instead, the Wayback Machine is a collection of many web crawls as well as other independent feeds and datasets; some of these are fun by the Internet Archive itself and some are run by “partners and contributors” (Leetaru, 2016). These tools work in parallel to the important work of individual users who add to the collection page-by-page.</p>

<p>Now we will examine the tools available for users who wish to add to the collection. There are multiple options available for users who wish to do so. Three are highlighted on the homepage of the Wayback Machine. First are “Tools,” that is, browser extensions and add-ons. These tools are available for all of the major web browsers as well as for mobile platforms (ios and Android). Once installed, these extensions and add-ons allow users to save one web page at a time without having to start at the Wayback Machine website each time (Save Pages in the Wayback Machine). The next option displayed on the homepage is “Subscription Service,” also known as an “Archive-It Account.” This is a subscription service that allows users to run their own crawling projects (in parallel to the Wayback Machine’s own crawling operations). Users are able to decide what web content to crawl and how often, even if they do not have technical expertise (Save Pages in the Wayback Machine). The next option listed on the homepage for users wishing to add to the collection is an online form under the heading, “Save Page Now.” Users simply copy and paste a URL into the field and hit “Save Now.” (Between the second and last functions is a search tool, to be described in the next paragraph). There is a fourth option for users who wish to save web content to the collection and that is a Wikipedia JavaScript Bookmarklet; this is a “one-click button” that can be used like an online book to either see a “dead page” or save an extant web page (Save Pages in the Wayback Machine).</p>

<p>The Wayback Machine offers those users intending to just casually browse the collection some convenient options. The first is a carousel of collection highlights on the homepage. The carousel is horizontal and takes up the entire width of the homepage, occupying the middle third of the homepage. The carousel offers a moving sample of web pages collected in the archive by displaying icons of each page. As the user scrolls over each icon, the webpage displays the name of the website with the date and timestamp of the web page capture. This feature gives users the ability to casually browse the collection even if they do not have a subject area, website, or specific time period in mind to search for.</p>

<p>The final category of Wayback Machine users is made up of users who are searching the collection for specific web material. The Wayback Machine offers these users two search-bars on the homepage. The first is located in the top center of the homepage and with text inviting the user to enter a specific URL or keywords related to their search. The second search-bar is located in the bottom third of the homepage between the tools discussed above, and this search-bar is labeled a “Collection Search.” This tool includes a search bar and a drop-down menu that features selected collections, including but not limited to “COVID,” “Donald Trump’s Tweets,” “Hong Kong news organizations that have been shut down,” and “Russian Independent Media Archive.” There are over 40 collections listed in the dropdown menu. This tool allows users who wish to search a selected collection to localize their search to that collection, rather than the entire archive of the Wayback Machine. Once a search term is entered into either search-bar, the user is sent to a results page which features a search-bar at the top page and the option to select a collection to search in from a dropdown menu.</p>

<p>Once a user has entered a search term and begun to explore the results, they will find the results displayed in a unique interface. That is because, as discussed before, the Wayback Machine captures web pages in multiple instances and displays them in chronological order. Search results feature metadata including the number of captures, the period of time captured and archived, and the number of web pages and images saved to the collection. Once a user opens up a specific search result, they will encounter data visualizations showing the amount of data collected over time and the option to display capture timestamps collected per day. The search results also offer “Collections, “Changes,” “Summary,” “Site Map,” and “URL.” Each tool offers additional data visualizations with explanatory text explaining the purpose of said data visualization (except for the “URL” option, which displays a list. </p>

<h3>Part II: Critical Analysis and Recommendations</h3>

<p>The Wayback Machine offers an incredible service, particularly given the challenges inherent in trying to archive the entire internet! These challenges include the need to design for three different categories of users, the necessity of archiving material that changes over time, and the sheer volume of web pages already in the collection (let alone online and waiting to be added to the collection!). While the Wayback Machine is a fairly straightforwardly designed and user-friendly website, the website’s visual interface, navigation, and search functionality could be greatly improved.</p>

<p>The visual interface of the Wayback Machine’s website could be much better designed. The homepage in particular is a missed opportunity in terms of layout, use of color, and arrangement of information. The homepage features a great deal of white background space coupled with a lot of information, particularly in the bottom third where tools are listed for adding to or searching the collection. The homepage features a moving carousel, but the thumbnail icons in the carousel are small and hard to read (particularly if the user is visually impaired). All in all, this creates a visual mismatch that overwhelms the user’s attention, violating the principles of Human-Computer Interaction which call for thoughtful use of color, size, motion, and brightness to engage the viewer’s attention (Syn, 2025, p. 14). Overall, the design of the Wayback Machine’s webpage is utilitarian and sparse. This presents a missed opportunity to use color, layout, and brightness in a strategic way to grab the user’s attention and emphasize important content (Syn, 2025, p.16-20). Most users (excepting those adding to the collection with browser extensions or add-ons) will interact with the visual interface of the Wayback Machine. However, the visual interface is especially important for the user experience of those users browsing or searching the collection as they spend more time interacting with the website itself. A more dynamic and enjoyable user experience could encourage more use of the website, particularly among casual users who are browsing the collection for recreation.</p>

<p>The Wayback Machine website’s navigation could also be much improved to improve the user experience for all three categories of users. The first problem area is between the wider Internet Archive website and the Wayback Machine. As mentioned above, there is a navigation bar at the top of the website with hyperlinks to key parts of the Internet Archive’s website, such as the “About” page or categories of archived material, like “Audio.” The first issue is that users of the Wayback Machine might become confused and try to use this navigation bar to find their way around the Wayback Machine itself. Finally, there is no navigation bar for the Wayback Machine itself. Helpful background pages - such as “General Information about the Wayback Machine” or “Save Pages in the Wayback Machine” are not easy to find from the homepage. In my experience, it was easier to find these pages via a Google search than via the homepage of the Wayback Machine. This violates Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics for User Interface Design, which call for “Recognition Rather than Recall:” under this principle, users “should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another” (Nielsen, 1994). In other words, a user should be able to navigate back to certain pages without having to resort to a Google search! A second issue is that the website is not organized based on the category of user. This would be helpful because the user experience varies greatly depending on the user’s purpose. As it stands, the tools for users adding to the collection or browsing or searching the navigation jumbled up on the homepage.</p>

<p>Improvement to the search functionality would greatly improve the user experience on the Wayback Machine website. The first potential area of confusion is the search bar on the top navigation page. This search bar is a tool to search the entire collection of the Internet Archive, rather than the specific collection of the Wayback Machine. This is potentially confusing for users. A second area of confusion - or at least redundancy - is that there are two search bars on the homepage for users to search the Wayback Machine. This means that the homepage has three search bars in total. Aside from the sheer number of search bars on the homepage, the inclusion of the two search bars for the Wayback Machine collection creates confusion because the relationship between the two might be unclear. In addition, there is no “advanced search” functionality akin to those in most online databases or online archives. This violates one of Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics: Match Between the System and the Real World (Nielsen, 1994). Users who are experienced with other online archives will naturally expect this functionality but it is not available for the Wayback Machine. There are no options to filter results by date, keyword, or other filtering options commonly found on online databases or online archives. Instead, the Wayback Machine offers seemingly simple search results with a tremendous amount of information available once the user has opened up a specific result. As discussed above, the search results include multiple data visualizations to show web captures over time and helpful explanatory text for users new to the data visualizations. </p>

<p>Many of these critiques could be easily addressed. Overall, the Wayback Machine website should incorporate strategic use of color, images, and relative size to create a more visually appealing and clearly demarcated user experience. Based on the principles of Human-Computer Interaction, these design improvements would help catch and hold user attention and aid navigation (Syn, 2025). Specific upgrades could include replacing the extensive white background with a colored background which would help emphasize different sections of the homepage. The homepage carousel could be larger to better highlight the sample material from the collection. Beyond updating visual cues, the overall navigation of the website would be much more intuitive if the website was organized by user group. The different categories of users - those adding to the collection, browsing the collection, or searching the collection - have different needs and the website should be explicitly organized so that each category of user follows a distinct navigational track. These updates could be made by grouping hyperlinks by category on the homepage or by making explicit hyperlinks for each category, leading to a distinct landing page for each group of users. The search functionality should also be streamlined. There is no need for three search bars on the homepage! It makes logical sense for there to be a search bar in the top navigation bar for the Internet Archive, but the two search bars for the Wayback Machine should be consolidated into just one. I recommend the main search bar (in the middle of the homepage) should remain and the “Collection Search” should be converted to a carousel, a hyperlink, or a subsection with hyperlinks to each collection rather than a search bar. Finally, users searching the collection would benefit from an advanced search function that follows conventions of other online archives. Given that this collection must be displayed so differently than a traditional archival collection, more explanatory text or video about how to search the collection and interpret results would be hugely beneficial.</p>

<h3>Part IV: Conclusion</h3>

<p>The Wayback Machine is a truly groundbreaking initiative and a one-of-its-kind archive. As more and more art, media, journalism, and civic discourse originates online, archiving internet content will become more and more important. The Wayback Machine does an admirable job providing a user-friendly interface for contributors, casual browsers, and dedicated searchers. By incorporating lessons from Human-Computer Interaction and Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics for User Interface Design, the administrators of the Wayback Machine can create a dynamic user experience that matches the ambition, innovation, and principles of the Wayback Machine itself. </p>
